Iteration 1 feedback not incorporated (explanation for the jargons used in the feature list and the use case) [-2 points]. No other changes required in the feature list as it looks sound and complete.

### UI sketches

The UI sketches now include a gameplay in action (as per iteration 1 feedback) and gives a good idea of the entire application's workflow.
