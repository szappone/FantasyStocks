### Implementation progress
- Dev stack all stood up
- Few core features working
- Basic demo Running
- Overall, progress is a little slow. There is also a noticeable mismatch between the frontend and backend progress, which matters in full stack projects.

### Design check-in

**Is the project on-track in terms of the evolved design?**
Mostly. But not quite there. By this time, it is expected to see some core features implemented so that we see the non CRUD feature in sight.
[-5 points]

**It is still a good amount of work given how it has evolved?**
There is still a good amount of work to do, but I am confident that the team will be able to pull it off.

**Are there flaws emerging in the design, or features that should be added or removed?**
No significant features to be added or removed

### Code Quality

- Both front-end and back-end file structure is well separated. Good work.
- But, the backend code has tests with no assertions.
- Also, there are "HelloWorld*" classes and remnants of boilerplate code.

[-5 points]


### Git usage
- Good use of Pull Requests. But many branch names are not meaningful and don't represent the feature.
- As a general rule, long lived branches are best avoided. Get rid of branches you don't need anymore.

[-4 points]

The team's individual contributions seem skewed. Some members do not have enough contributions in the codebase. Each member is expected to have significant contributions to the code.

#### Use of the GitHub issue tracker to manage bugs, features, etc.
Yes

#### Codebase pushed to master on your team's GitHub repository for our inspection
Yes

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
README looks good and was able to build both front-end and back-end using the instructions. Good work

#### Top-level file CHANGELOG.md present in your repo and describes progress in this iteration well
CHANGELOG.md has some basic information of the progress

#### Use of GitHub's project boards to keep track of your progress
Project boards are well-maintained

### Other Remarks
- Keep up the good work!
- Keep the backend and frontend work in sync.
- The core logic (the non-CRUD) part is vital to your project's completion, which is to be implemented on the backend in your case. Plan your tasks and team assignments to get to it as soon as you can.

**Grade: 86/100**
