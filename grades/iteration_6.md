# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 8 FantasyStocks

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Good.

#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

You have some hard-coded users to remove, also the auth token is hard-coded.  Code otherwise looks good in what you showed.

Good invalid input checking in frontend.

The demo did not allow stocks to be picked - a problem with the API to the stocks database.

No password was required on login


#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

The UI was a little clunky - don't center the names, layout was simple (the stocks should have been in a grid for less scrolling), etc.  It was  functional however.  Lots of nice styling and presentation in the proposed mockups were not implemented.

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

You needed to include a time warp feature in your test harness and for the demo; overall the testing of the full gameplay ended up being thin and we never saw the game to completion in the demo.  For our part we should have told you this earlier but it did not become clear until the demo.

Other than that, unit test coverage is +80%. Good work making the coverage tool happy.

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

You did not have the deployed version in the demo.

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

Nice! Lots of stock calculation and gameplay

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

Except for the UI part, I think you guys have done a good job -- Srivathsa]]

### Overall Remarks

You had a great idea and plan for the project but did not show us the whole game play in the demo and did not have the stock quotes part working unfortunately.  Given the lack of updated quotes you should have just used historical data which you can download in bulk and store locally, and only run the game "in the past".   That plus a warp mode would have allowed testing and demoing of the full app.

**Grade: 89/100**
