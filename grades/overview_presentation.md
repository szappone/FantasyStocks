OOSE Project Overview Presentation Evaluation
---------------------------------------------
**Group 08**

**Evaluators: [Srivathsa, Pasumarthi](mailto:pvsriv@cs.jhu.edu) and [Menon, Hari](mailto:hmenon@cs.jhu.edu)**

### Attendance and contribution

Good!

### Overview of project

The overview was reasonable, given the time constraints. However keep in mind that the general audience is likely less aware of how stock markets work and the associated terminology compared to you. So you may want to go in to a little bit more detail at the start.

(-1 Points)

### Demo

Reasonable for this point in time. However you should make sure that your front-end and back-end are being developed in sync and well-integrated.

### Architecture

Good.

### Code review

Reasonable. We would have liked to see a little bit more of your scoring algorithm work.

(-1 Points)

### Presentation organization

It was organized well.

### Talking

Good

### Quality of slides

Generally fine. However some slides were a little too text dense - e.g the slides for the scoring algorithm; here a better depiction like a flowchart, or something similar would be preferable.

(-4 Points)

### Project comments emerging during the talk

- Thought about caching data 3rd party services?

- How are you maintaining the sessions? DB or browser cache?

- The scoring algorithm as was explained during the talk appears to be a simple query on your database once you have collected information from the quantl api. This feels somewhat simple to be the (only) non-CRUD feature in your app. You should discuss this with your advisor(s) and/or Prof Scott

**Grade:  94/100**
