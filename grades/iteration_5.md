# Iteration 5 Evaluation - Group 08

**Evaluator: [Srivathsa, Pasumarthi](mailto:pvsriv@cs.jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress

* Not able to see the scoring algorithm being implemented in the front end. It will be helpful to include detailed steps to view
non-CRUD features in the UI. [-5 points]
* UI is still very basic. Should speed up front end development to match the proposed mockups [-3 points]

#### Code Quality

* Overall code quality is good.

### Testing and Coverage

* Backend tests fail [priceCalculatorTest fails - please check this. Had to comment this out for the `make test` command to run
    successfully] [-3 points]
* Overall coverage for dao and service implementations are ~ 65%. Ignore unnecessary files so that it doesn't lower your coverage
percentage (actual coverage for the entire backend code is 19%!) [-5 points]

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
README is informative and has all information to build the app and test it

### Deployment
Deployed on Google Cloud

### Advanced Git usage
